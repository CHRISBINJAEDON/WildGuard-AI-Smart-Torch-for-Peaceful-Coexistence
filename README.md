## 🔦 What It Does

WildGuard AI is a handheld, rechargeable torch that:
- Emits red LED flashes to deter animals
- Simulates flame visuals for non-lethal repulsion
- Plays eco-friendly warning sounds
- Future upgrades include:
  - AI-powered motion detection
  - Species recognition
  - Smart alerts via mobile app
  - Blockchain-based incident logging

## 🌱 Project Vision

Our team also developed a **Disaster Alert System (SDAS)**, shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/wqNK9tvEdFM), which complements **WildGuard AI** by providing early warnings for natural hazards. Together, these tools form a **youth-led safety ecosystem** for rural communities, combining **AI, IoT, and ethical design**.

SDAS empowers vulnerable regions with real-time alerts for floods, landslides, and extreme weather—helping save lives and build resilience.

---

## 🚨 What It Does

- Detects environmental anomalies (rainfall, vibration, temperature)
- Triggers sirens and LED strobes for local alerts
- Sends mobile notifications via Firebase
- Logs incidents to a cloud dashboard for NGOs and forest departments
- Future upgrades:
  - AI-based anomaly detection
  - Blockchain logging for disaster events
  - Mesh network integration with WildGuard AI

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

### Hardware
- DHT11 / BMP280 sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- Vibration sensor (landslide detection)
- Arduino Nano / ESP32 microcontroller
- Buzzer + LED array (alert system)
- Rechargeable battery (solar-ready)

### Software
- Arduino IDE (firmware)
- Firebase Realtime DB (mobile alerts)
- Node.js + Express (dashboard backend)
- TensorFlow Lite (AI anomaly detection – planned)
- IPFS + Ethereum (blockchain logging – planned)

# 🌿 WildGuard AI: Smart Torch for Peaceful Coexistence

WildGuard AI is a youth-led innovation designed to reduce human–wildlife conflict in forest-fringe communities. It’s a handheld, rechargeable torch that uses red LED flashes, flame visuals, and sound effects to safely deter wild animals—without harming biodiversity.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Team**: Chrisbin Jaedon, Chrisbin Liana, Johan Danieo R, Chrisbin Jeeva  
- **School**: Sacred Heart International School, Tamil Nadu, India  
- **Hackathon**: Youth Coders Hack 2025  
- **SDG Alignment**: SDG 3, 9, 11, 13, 15  

## 🌱 Inspiration

Traditional deterrents like fire, crackers, and fences are dangerous and ineffective. WildGuard AI was inspired by the need for a safer, eco-friendly solution that empowers communities and protects wildlife.

## 🔦 Features

- Red LED array for visual deterrence  
- Artificial flame simulation  
- Eco-friendly sound effects  
- Rechargeable battery and ergonomic casing  
- Future: AI motion detection, species recognition, smart alerts  
- Future: Blockchain-based incident logging via Ethereum/IPFS
